Description of memhack functionality:

each time we want to figure out the next letter in the password. since the check password check goes over a
sequence in memory, if we'll locate are known letters such that it will end by the end of the accessible memory - 1 byte
at the last byte of the accessible memory we can try to put all the other legal letters. if we hit the right one, the
loop will go to one more iterate where it will get a segmentation fault, otherwise it'll return false because it founded
a mismatch with password. therefore each time will locate our known letters accordingly to find the next one
with segfault until we have all letters
